# PlayerNotifier
PlayerNotifier is a 1.8.9 forge Minecraft mod aimed to help pit players with informations
on their game. It was made using OneConfig for GUI and HUD.
## Features
- ### Enemy Tracking :
<<<<<<< HEAD
  On join of a lobby or when an enemy joins your lobby, the mod will send a message in chat telling that the enemy is here. When the enemy leaves the lobby you will also receive a chat message.
  You will also see the enemies and their distance from you on the Enemies HUD.
  Managing your enemy list : can be done either by adding usernames to watchlist.txt in your config folder. Or by using the "/watchlist" (or "/wl") command, you can chose "add" or "remove" as the first argument and then   the username you want to add or remove.

- ### Dark Pants Tracking :
  On the Dark HUD you will see the players wearing dark pants their distance from you and the enchant on those dark pants. If the pants are tier 1 or fresh it will say the enchant is fresh. It might not show all the darks on the map since this feature can only detect players rendered on your client.

- ### Nicked Players Tracking :
  As of now I did not make a denicker tho I started by adding an HUD on which you can see every nicked players in your lobby.
